A Fullstack application that I developed for the needs of a local physio center.
The admin (after logging in with his account) have access to a personal calendar to schedule, edit and delete appointments. 
Moreover, not only he can add and edit patients information, but also see their appointment-medical history. In addition, 
the admin can see the metrics of the year (total appointments per category and total Earnings per year). 
Settings are included in the app. The app is 100% responsive

Tech Used: TypeScript, React.JS, Bootstrap5, HTML5, CSS3, Firebase/Firestore
